process of breaking up a given text into units called tokens. Tokens can be individual words, phrases or even whole sentences. In the process of tokenization, some characters like punctuation marks may be discarded. The tokens usually become the input for the processes like parsing and text mining.\r\n","              Almost every Natural language processing task uses some sort of tokenisation technique. It is vital to understand the pattern in the text to achieve tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition also known as NER, POS tagging, Text classification, intelligent chatbot, language translation, text summarisation and many more. \r\n","              These tokens are very useful for finding such patterns as well as is considered as a base step for stemming and lemmatization. Stemming and Lemmatization both generate the root form of the inflected words obtained from tokenisation.\r\n","              Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, artificial intelligence, information engineering, and human-computer interaction. This field focuses on how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. It is difficult to perform as the process of reading and understanding languages is far more complex than it seems at first glance.\"\"\""],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"yyYeW_qzRcg2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1612985398297,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4114,"user":{"displayName":"SAI SHARAN K","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GioV7bBYVU_D3pzHwzYRy7QnQUS3tJWaPrtn1q8RA=s64","userId":"06407441015676207791"}}},"source":["ps = PorterStemmer()\r\n","sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(paragraph)\r\n","wordnet = WordNetLemmatizer()\r\n","corpus = []\r\n","for i in range(len(sentences)):\r\n","  review  = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', sentences[i])\r\n","  review = review.lower()\r\n","  review = review.split()\r\n","  review = [wordnet.lemmatize(word) for word in review if not word in set(stopwords.words('english'))]\r\n","  review  = ' '.join(review)\r\n","  corpus.append(review)"],"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"gJoTCOirSJPW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1612985398300,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4114,"user":{"displayName":"SAI SHARAN K","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GioV7bBYVU_D3pzHwzYRy7QnQUS3tJWaPrtn1q8RA=s64","userId":"06407441015676207791"}}},"source":["#Bag Of Words Model\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n","cv = CountVectorizer()\n","X = cv.fit_transform(corpus).toarray()"],"execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"dLUp0D6FW5Iv","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1612985398300,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4110,"user":{"displayName":"SAI SHARAN K","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GioV7bBYVU_D3pzHwzYRy7QnQUS3tJWaPrtn1q8RA=s64","userId":"06407441015676207791"}},"outputId":"26e7a7d9-c576-4f25-c247-78087fa12993"},"source":["print(X)"],"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["[[0 0 0 ... 0 0 0]\n"," [0 0 0 ... 0 1 1]\n"," [0 0 0 ... 0 0 0]\n"," ...\n"," [0 0 0 ... 0 0 0]\n"," [0 0 0 ... 0 0 0]\n"," [0 0 0 ... 0 0 0]]\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"fzJs3lF2aKP3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1612985398301,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4106,"user":{"displayName":"SAI SHARAN K","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GioV7bBYVU_D3pzHwzYRy7QnQUS3tJWaPrtn1q8RA=s64","userId":"06407441015676207791"}},"outputId":"6340b0bc-99a3-450b-eaac-76bf6991c48d"},"source":["corpus"],"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['tokenisation process breaking given text unit called token',\n"," 'token individual word phrase even whole sentence',\n"," 'process tokenization character like punctuation mark may discarded',\n"," 'token usually become input process like parsing text mining',\n"," 'almost every natural language processing task us sort tokenisation technique',\n"," 'vital understand pattern text achieve task like sentiment analysis named entity recognition also known ner po tagging text classification intelligent chatbot language translation text summarisation many',\n"," 'token useful finding pattern well considered base step stemming lemmatization',\n"," 'stemming lemmatization generate root form inflected word obtained tokenisation',\n"," 'natural language processing nlp subfield computer science artificial intelligence information engineering human computer interaction',\n"," 'field focus program computer process analyze large amount natural language data',\n"," 'difficult perform process reading understanding language far complex seems first glance']"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":7}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"EXKKvy5SaO4G","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1612985398301,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4104,"user":{"displayName":"SAI SHARAN K","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GioV7bBYVU_D3pzHwzYRy7QnQUS3tJWaPrtn1q8RA=s64","userId":"06407441015676207791"}}},"source":[""],"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]}]}
